# Fiti


## Setup

1. Run npm install
2. Open the Fiti folder in Expo XDE and wait for it to finish opening
    - Project > open Project > Select the Fiti folder
3. Now, you can just edit the code with any text editor and Expo will live reload
  changes on your phone for you!
4. Expo XDE will now also stream any  **console logs/errors/warnings** from your phone to this window
5. **Before you continue**, try launching the app on your phone now to make sure it works

**IMPORTANT:** You can also reload manually if live-reloading doesn't seem to be working
  - Live reloading can be a bit finicky ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ so if you aren't
    seeing your changes try manual reloading

**Note:** If you are having **connection issues**... (in order)
  - Make sure you don't have duplicate apps open in the background of your phone
  - Move on and try again in a couple minutes \- this usually does work, be patient
  - Try publishing and then normally connecting again
  - Press restart and/or restarting expo itself
  - Still nothing? Resist the urge to flip a table and ask for help in the
    queue + keep trying every now and then
